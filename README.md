# A-Software-to-Solve-Question-6-in-the-CSMC-Contest-2022-and-Related-Questions

As Question #6 in the CSMC contest in 2022-2023 presented a question about the possibility in some circumstances, I find such questions are practical in our daily life and can be solved in a faster and more precise way using this software. This software allows users to input the number of colors, define the number of balls in each color and then choose a color. After that, the software should calculate the answer for the following case: Consider balls in different colors are sorted by colors and then put into bags respectively. The balls are chosen randomly and removed one at a time from the bag until all the balls are removed.  One color of balls is the first to have 0 remaining in the bag. What is the probability that this color is the chosen one?
